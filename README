These programs were developed to use CDSEIS with arbitrary SEED volumes.

The key program is makelog, which takes a SEED volume and a catalog and
associates the time windows in the SEED volume with a catalog and produces
a log file of event information and stations recording the event, and the
duration of the time window for each station.  It is now distributed along
with CDSEIS: see 

   https://github.com/ghfbsd/cdseis

makelog usage:

makelog [-s][-d][-cat {std | cmt}] <directory> [<catalog>]

where:
   -cat std - format of the catalog is free-format lines
   -cat cmt - format of the catalog is CMT .dek/.ndk format

   If the SEED volume is event oriented (contains event information), then
   this parameter is not required. 

   -s - dump station info only, no log file
   -d - debug (repeat for more information)

   <directory> - the name of the directory where the SEED volume is located.

   This keeps names short in log files.  If your SEED volume is located in
   /Users/doofus/event/data/20020103.seed, then this parameter should be
   /Users/doofus/event/data (and the standard input should be 20020103.seed).

   <catalog> - the full path name of the catalog, if required.

   Catalog is either in the CMT .dek/.ndk format, or in a series of
   ascending order free-format lines:
      yyyy mo dy hh mm ss lat lon depth maga magb

There is a man-style page for more detailed information.  Read via:
